# Native PPTX Export and Editability Baseline

- All visible titles must be exported as native PowerPoint text boxes.
- Body text must be exported as native PowerPoint text boxes unless the source is an unreadable raster image.
- Simple rectangles, rounded rectangles, circles, dividers, and arrows must be exported as native PowerPoint shapes.
- Tables must be exported as native PowerPoint tables whenever the cell structure is clear.
- Charts should be exported as native charts when data is available. If only a screenshot is available, use an image asset and mark it in the editable report.
- Complex illustrations, photos, shadows, decorative textures, and noisy backgrounds may be exported as image assets.
- Full-slide raster fallback is only allowed when visual fidelity is explicitly more important than editability.

Level 5 means all major objects are native PowerPoint objects.
Level 4 means all text and main shapes are editable, while complex decorative assets may be rasterized.
Level 3 means text is editable, but many visual objects are rasterized.
Level 2 means only key text and a few shapes are editable.
Level 1 means full-slide raster fallback.
